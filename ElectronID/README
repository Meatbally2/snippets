Three example ROOT macros are provided as examples on how to include the Electron Finder in your analysis. They can also be run to get a ROOT tree with the scattered electrons. 

To run any of them, modify the beam setting, input files, and the type of electronID you want in the beginning of the file. Then run the ROOT macro in eic-shell.

- InclusvieSkim.C: Simple example on how to call the various functions in the electron library. Kinematics calculated using tracking and calorimeter information are also saved to the tree.

- InclusiveQA.C: Simple example on saving the scattered electrons to the output tree. QA plots for the cuts applied are made.

- ReconExample.C: Longer example for also testing the kinematic reconstruction using various algorithms.
