All members of the [EIC Github Organization](https://github.com/eic) have read/write access and are welcome to push your
code directly to the main branch, no pull requests required!  It is strongly encouraged, however, to follow the recommendations
listed below.

### Recommendations

 * When adding code, it is suggested to include either a README or provide sufficient comments in the code which details basic usage,
   inputs, outputs, and so on.
 * There are several directories corresponding to the different focus groups within the EIC (e.g. Jets/Heavy Flavor, Tracking, etc.).
   In order to make it easier for others to find, it is suggested that you add your code to the relevant directory.
 * While no pull requests are required, we do ask that you follow standard etiquette for contributing to a shared repository.
